The front end has all functionalities implemented and all the keyboard shortcuts work, except the view submissions option doesn't work for the server database despite the server storing and saving the submitted forms.
However, I have tested the working of the view submissions on a local JSON file which follows the structure of the JSON file I have specified in the backend readme. It works on the file as intended.
The view submission form is dynamic, as can be seen in the code, as it views the key and value pairs directly as long as their are 5 of them.
The save submission form and the toggle options all work as intended, as can be seen in the server database I have specified how to access in the backend repo.
